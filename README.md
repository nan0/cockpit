# Home flight simulator cockpit

## Architecture
![Architecture](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1HWA0QZlIibJhXi94NdxQkQTR877IzZA3)

## Development Configuration
- The client and server script are developed in remote (SFTP) from PyCharm
- Both client and server are in the same github repo : [nan0/cockpit (github.com)](https://github.com/nan0/cockpit)
- Venv 
  - RPi.GPIO cannot be installed. Maybe try that later: [GPIOSimulator Â· PyPI](https://github.com/nan0/cockpit)
  - Save requirements : pip freeze > requirements.txt
  - Install requirements:
  - on Pi: : sudo python3 -m pip install -r /home/nan0/cockpit/requirements.txt
  - Python venv tuto [here](https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-create-requirements-txt-file-in-python)
  - Mayb try [PyWebOSTV](https://github.com/supersaiyanmode/PyWebOSTV) to control TVs

## Pi Configuration
- python client located in /home/nan0/cockpit/cockpit.py (with wol byte file alongside)
- A systemd service starts automatically with the pi
 - location /etc/systemd/system/cockpit.service
 - usage : sudo systemctl [start | stop | restart] cockpit.service
 - log: journalctl -f -u cockpit.service -p info (ctrl+c to exit)
 - if service file is updated, run : sudo systemctl daemon-reload
 - Systemd tuto [here](https://medium.com/codex/setup-a-python-script-as-a-service-through-systemctl-systemd-f0cc55a42267)

## Gaming PC Configuration
- python server located in startup scripts (windows+r and shell:startup)
- starts automatically when user session starts
- Incoming / Outgoing port 8765 open in windows firewall
- nansp user is automatically connected
